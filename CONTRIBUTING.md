### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: Work that needs developers to work on
- **qa-needed**: Work that needs additional testing or verification
- **documentation-needed**: Work that needs to be documented in `/docs/`
- **bug-high-priority**: High priority bugs
- **bug-low-priority**: Low priority bugs
- **help-wanted**: Help wanted

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
